# bulk_user_content_clone
Drupal 8 module that both imports users and then creates clones of a designated content type. 

### Note that we do not expect any further development of thsi Drupal module since we have moved to WordPress for development as of Nov 2022.

### Overview
This was initially started using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/bulk_user_registration" target="_blank">bulk_user_registration module</a> (27 Jul 2018 dev version). Capabilities were then added to be able to clone a designated custom content type for each imported user. The initial use case for this module is to be able to clone designated ELN modules for each student/researcher that is imported into a given Drupal 8 instance.
