# bulk_user_content_clone
Drupal 8 module that both imports users and then creates clones of a designated content type, This was initially started using the bulk_user_registration module from 27 Jul 2018 dev version. Capabilities were then added to be able to clone a designated custom content type for each imported user. The initial use case for this module is to be able to clone designated ELN modules for each student/researcher that is imported into a given Drupal 8 instance.
